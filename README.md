# Obsidian TERRACOTTA Topaz Theme

This is my modified theme who was inspired in the Blue-Topaz-theme from [whyt-byte](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css).

Yes, i know the name doesn't make any sense, but my project vault is named "TERRACOTTA" and i decided to stay with the "Topaz" original name, so he we are ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


This theme have only minors changes in colors, since i'm not a skilled person in CSS

I hope you enjoy!!! :smile:
